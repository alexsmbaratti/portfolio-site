# Portfolio-Site
*A dynamic site created from scratch*

Note: This project has been replaced with a GitHub pages static site. The static site is avaliable at https://alexsmbaratti.com.

## Motivation
For a while, I've wanted a website to serve as a portfolio for my projects. After taking a class on web development in university, I created this website during the winter break of that year. Building my own website from scratch allowed me more control and cost less than a website builder. Plus, it would be something I could call my own.

## Implementation
The site uses Node.js (and Express.js) to serve responses dynamically through EJS and JSON files. Aspects like experience and software projects are defined in a JSON file, which is parsed and rendered into an HTML response. This means layout files are shorter and it's easier to add additional content to the front page.

## See it for yourself!
